# Nessus Vulnerabilities Scan


<body> In this lab, I used Nessus vulnerability scanner to identify vulnerabilities on my home network and assess the risks associated with each vulnerability. 
Nessus is a popular vulnerability scanner that can be used to scan and identify vulnerabilities in a network, including servers, workstations, and 
other devices connected to the network. Some things i was able to also practice within this lab include:

○ Created and ran multple Nessus scans

○ Used the risk matrix to prioritize remediation efforts based on the risk level of each vulnerability
