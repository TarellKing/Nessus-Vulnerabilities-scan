# Nessus Vulnerabilities Scan


<body> In this lab, I used Nessus vulnerability scanner to identify vulnerabilities on my home network and assess the risks associated with each vulnerability. I conducted a host discovery scan and a basic network scan. While the host discovery scam came back as expected i was able to locate unkown vulnerabilities during my basic network scan.
Nessus is a popular vulnerability scanner that can be used to scan and identify vulnerabilities in a network, including servers, workstations, and other devices connected to the network.

 Key Contributions:

○ Assessed my home networks vulnerabilities

○ Created and ran multple Nessus scans

○ Used the risk matrix to prioritize remediation efforts based on the risk level of each vulnerability
